pip install pandas_datareader
from bokeh.embed import components --> to embed to chart to the website

df=data.DataReader(name="GOOG",data_source="yahoo",start=start_time, end=end_time) # AAPL is the stock symbol of apple, other company info can be found online

p=figure(x_axis_type="datetime", width=800, height=500, sizing_mode= "stretch_both", title= "Candlestick chart") # sizing_mode is used for making it responsive.

hours_12 = 12*60*60*1000 # converting 12 hours in milliseconds, as 12 h will be the width of the rect and it accepts only ms.

p.segment(df.index, df.High, df.index, df.Low, color= "#4c4d4c" ) # segment has 4 parament, highest x, higest y, lowest x, lowest y
# and we don't have to filter/specify anything as segments will be same for every row.
# As these are vertical segments, high x and low x are both the same --> df.index

p.rect(df.index[df.Status== "Increase"], df.Middle[df.Status== "Increase"], hours_12, df.Height[df.Status== "Increase"], fill_color="#33a6cc", line_color="#4fb7e3")
 # here we have to use 'rect', as it will take to the center of the graph, incase of 'quad' method the position will be 6h right and left shifted(thats how candlestick chart works) and we have to subtract 6h to bring it the center. # here we have to use 'rect',

# df.index[df.Close> df.Open] --> This is indicating to the x coordinate of the center of the rectangle
# (df.Open+ df.Close)/2 --> y coordingate
# abs(df.Open-df.Close) ---> height of the rect

components(p) --> to generate html and the javascript file of bokeh

cdn_js= CDN.js_files --> we will need to get the 'js' files from the html(local candlestick chart) and send to the flask app later
cdn_css= CDN.css_files --> same as above, this is for 'css' instead of 'js'
